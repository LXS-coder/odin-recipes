    <h1>Spaghetti aglio e olio</h1>

    <h2>Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, but even these are optional. In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make Spaghetti Aglio e Olio:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water before you drain it!</li>
        <li>Next, toast the garlic and red pepper flakes. Heat the oil in a large skillet and add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned around the edges.</li>
        <li>Then, add the kale. Toss it with the garlic oil and cook until it wilts</li>
        <li>Finally, stir in the pasta, along with the lemon juice and zest and a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss to combine, adding more pasta water, as needed, to create a light sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. That’s it!</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Garnish the pasta aglio e olio with parsley and Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy it on its own, or serve it with a salad like my Caesar salad, Caprese salad, or citrus salad. It would also be delicious with roasted broccoli or cauliflower and homemade focaccia or no-knead bread for sopping up any leftover oil. Buon appetito!</p>
